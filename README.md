# Chat

A simple application useful for exploring some **Java** code feautures. The idea of this repository is to be a full working point of reference and provides code solutions to beginners and not only them on some tricky points on **developing** **Java** applications, such as:

* **JavaRMI** client server application
* **JavaFX** Gui programming
* **Gradle** project setup 

## How it works

1. Build the project.

    `./gradlew build`
    
2. Start the server jar.

    `java -jar build/libs/Chat_Server.jar`

3. Start any number of clients you want!

    `java -jar build/libs/Chat_Client.jar`
